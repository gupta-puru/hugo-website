##### Abstract

We consider the classical single commodity newsvendor problem in a stochastic setup where the commodity price distribution satisfies martingale and marginal constraints derived from no–arbitrage arguments. We show that there is strong duality between optimization problem of the newsvendor and the canonical martingale Schrodinger bridge ([Schrödinger, 1932](http://www.numdam.org/item/AIHP_1932__2_4_269_0.pdf)) – the entropy minimizing martingale coupling amongst all equivalent martingale couplings of marginal distributions of the ex–ante and ex–post spot prices. We obtain primal as well as dual attainment results under mild restrictions on the physical probability measure and characterize the optimal inventory policy of the buyer in terms of its dual martingale Schrodinger bridge.
